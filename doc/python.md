## Variable Naming
1. variable name cannot start with number

[Python Keywords](https://realpython.com/python-keywords/#:~:text=%20Python%20Keywords%20and%20Their%20Usage%20%201,are%20used%20for%20control%20flow%3A%20if%2C...%20More%20)
4. Avoid using existing function name as your variable name.
otherwise, your python builtins functions no longer works the way you expected.
